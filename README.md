## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project focused on Credit Risk in Loan applications. 
The project aims to explore historical data related to credit risk in loan approvals and build predictive models 
to assess and manage credit risk.

The dataset, spanning from 2007 to 2014, offers a comprehensive overview of individuals who sought loans during this period. 
It encapsulates a wealth of information pertaining to loan applicants, providing valuable insights into their financial profiles, 
credit histories, and the outcomes of their loan applications. The data serves as a crucial resource for understanding 
the diverse backgrounds and financial circumstances of borrowers, shedding light on their creditworthiness and the overall status 
of the loans they applied for. This rich dataset becomes an invaluable tool for financial analysis, enabling researchers and 
analysts to draw meaningful conclusions about lending patterns, risk assessment, and the broader landscape of borrower 
characteristics over the specified timeframe.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Understanding and Cleaning:** Thorough examination and cleaning of the credit risk loan dataset to ensure data quality.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth exploration of interesting insights derived from the credit risk loan dataset.

- **Data Preparation:** Includes preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling.

- **Predictive Modeling:** Utilization of machine learning techniques to predict credit risk in loan applications.

## Data Preparation

- **Handling Missing Values:** Employed strategies such as imputation or removal of missing values.

- **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Converted categorical variables into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding.

- **Scaling Features:** Ensured consistency in scale for features using methods like Standard scaling.

- **Handling Imbalance:** Applied techniques to address class imbalance, such as oversampling.

- **Multicollinearity Study:** Investigated and mitigated multicollinearity among features.

- **Feature Selection:** Selected relevant features to improve model performance.

## Skills Applied

- **Programming:** Implemented using Python for data manipulation and analysis.

- **Statistical Analysis:** Applied statistical methods to extract meaningful patterns from the credit risk loan data.

- **Machine Learning:** Developed predictive models using machine learning algorithms to assess credit risk.

- **Data Visualization:** Visualized insights using charts and graphs for better comprehension.
